Map War 3

To start the program, run Core.py. The program is currently in development.
The program requires Settings.txt, NationNames.txt and LeaderNames.txt in the same directory as Core.py to run.
Those three files can be edited to change the game, but be careful not to break the format.

What is to be done?
- Map
- Interface
- Division into single player and multi player
- Pick technology rates (5% to 25%) every 5 turns, input for player, random for AIs
