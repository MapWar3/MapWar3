so instead of making forum posts, in map war 3, we pass around turn files. the gui and the ai makes turn files. both the turn files and the world file is sent to the processor, which makes modifications to the world file. the world file is given to the ai and the players so they can take their next turn.

also disregard the nation file thing. it's easier to store the nations, map, and everything in a single file.
the turn processor just does the calculations that change every turn, and the round processor calculates changes every round.
